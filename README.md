# R_MLB2019

This code was written by a yankee fan and is not trying in any way to be a real analysis of the (Boom)Stros of 2019, 
the main idea to create this software is to show that I can write code in R and to show to recruiting managers and
recruiters.

If you run the code you can find two charts:
1- A point plot showing OBP vs SLG% per team and sizing every team according its 2019-season-team batting average.
2- A histogram showing Strike Outs.

In both cases the Stros performed really well.

If you want access to the data I use the baseball-reference site data, you can find the table I use here:
https://www.baseball-reference.com/leagues/MLB/2019.shtml#teams_standard_batting::21

If you download the table as .cvs file the add the address and run the code.

All the code is commented, so you can understand it.
